# How it works?

the script will generate a programming quote for you then he will create a new README using the static one plus the quote.

**Inspired by**: [Dev.to](https://dev.to/elkhatibomar/generate-programming-quotes-in-readme-every-day-2g56 "Dev.to")

**Thanks for providing quotes API: [Quote API](https://github.com/skolakoda/programming-quotes-api "Quote API")**

**Quote of the day**
> Thoroughly testing a program is impossible (requires unbounded number of test cases); so try to choose test cases that will expose all errors. Thatâ€™s very difficult, especially since we do not know what all the errors are, and if we did, we would not need the test cases!
